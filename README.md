# Employee Management System

## Purpose of Assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to create an interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. In order to do this, I had to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## How It Works Demo

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I start the application
* THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
* WHEN I choose to view all departments
* THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
* WHEN I choose to view all roles
* THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
* WHEN I choose to view all employees
* THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
* WHEN I choose to add a department
* THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
* WHEN I choose to add a role
* THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
* WHEN I choose to add an employee
* THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
* WHEN I choose to update an employee role
* THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 

## Grading Requirements
